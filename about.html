            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                The Bridge for Sustainable Development (BRISUD) is a community-based
                initiative founded in Mtwara, Tanzania, with the goal of empowering
                individuals and communities through free learning practices, leadership
                development, innovation, and sustainable solutions. The initiative was
                established to address persistent challenges such as limited access to
                quality education, scarcity of resources, unemployment among youth,
                and unequal development opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                BRISUD was motivated by the need to create a practical bridge between
                knowledge and real-life application. By focusing on culturally relevant
                approaches and community participation, BRISUD enables individuals to
                develop skills, confidence, and resilience necessary for sustainable
                socio-economic growth.
